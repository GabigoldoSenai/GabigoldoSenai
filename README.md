# Hello World! ğŸ‘‹
My name is LetÃ­cia G., but you can call me Gabigol~ I'm a full-stack student in SENAI - AL. I love creating **creative design websites** and I'm not afraid to learn a thousand things to do it. My favorite technologies are JS, CSS and HTML. To learn outside of the programming course, I love browsing Pinterest and YouTube, asking for help only when needed.
